## Configuring the project

Simply download/clone the project on the system and import it in Android Studio.
Now we need to configure the project. 

**SDK Version**

Now you will see that gradle cannot be sync because it missing some parameters. Open to **gradle.properties** file in the root of the project and add the following lines.

```
MIN_SDK = 15
ANDROID_BUILD_SDK_VERSION = 23
ANDROID_BUILD_TOOLS_VERSION = 21.1.0
ANDROID_BUILD_TARGET_SDK_VERSION = 23
ANDROID_COMPILE_SDK_VERSION = 23
```
> **Note:**
>You should make sure that the correct SDK versions and build tools are installed in Android Studio. To do this open the Preferences panel and navigate to **Appearance & Behavour** -> **System Settings** -> **Android SDK** or click on the **SDK Manager** icon in the tool bar. Android SDK versions 4.4 and onwards should be installed. **Android SDK Build-Tools** version 21.1.0 should be installed. 

**Update Gradle**

Next open the **build.gradle** file for your project. It should be called **build.gradle (Project: Your-project-name)**  

Update this file by adding the following.    

buildscript {  
    repositories {  
        jcenter()  
    }  
    dependencies {  
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:1.2.3'  

        // NOTE: Do not place your application dependencies here; they belong  
        // in the individual module build.gradle files  
    }  
}  

allprojects {  
    repositories {  
        jcenter()  
    }  
}  

Now run Gradle to get the project ready to be compiled. The project should now compile without error.
